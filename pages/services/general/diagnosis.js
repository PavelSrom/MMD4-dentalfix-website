              Regular dental cleanings are important for keeping your teeth healthy.
              Please, do not underestimate dental cleaning. Usually brushing and flossing
              are not enough for removing all the bacteria that can occur even on your
              teeth. Cleanings remove plague and tartar which can lead to oral infection.
